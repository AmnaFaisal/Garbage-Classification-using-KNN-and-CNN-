Garbage-Classification-using-KNN-and-CNN-Classifier

Project description:
In Pakistan, we are accustomed to seeing piles of accumulated garbage in various urban and rural areas, which gives rise to an unhygienic environment and increase in pollution. In order to dispose of or recycle garbage, it is important to separate it into different categories, which is usually done by manually handpicking through it. 
We intent to develop a garbage classification system to assist the process of recycling. The main goal of our proposed methodology is to easily and efficiently determine the type of garbage item by looking at the input image, classify it accurately into its respective category and tell us whether the item is recyclable or not. 
Recycling is made easier with effective Garbage Classification, and it is an important initiative in creating a better environment.

Dataset:
The dataset we have selected consists of images that have been labelled with their respective categories. We will split the data into two parts, test data and training data. Our data mining models will learn patterns from the training data and then predict labels for the test data.

Algorithms used:
Multiclass Classification algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) and Deep Learning algorithms based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are good candidates for solving the problem at hand. We will test our model using these algorithms, compare the accuracy scores, and then choose the algorithm that gives the most accurate results.
